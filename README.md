# RyMat

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">CURRENTLY IN TESTING</p>

RyMat is my personal texture painting / material editing add-on for Blender that adds a layer based user interface, baking, exporting and file management tools. This add-on is open-source and 100% free, so everyone has the freedom to create.

Cheers!
